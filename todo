grasp lower to have connector more stable OK
reduce randomness OK
retrain: show more examples with connector half-in /
 label as success only when it is in
test tcp eda01 OK -> still not
check training plots OK ?
check cams: how to know connector pose rel to gripper OK ? possibly reprint                     

do not use action
try pcb grasp_pose traget_psoe

make robot more compliant? -> lowered stiffness
do not use side cam in image_keys
debug erratic behavior
check huge initial cost when using two or more classifier data
**train classifier/learner in my pc (with GPU) -> maybe that is why policy is not converging?**
adjust housing cad to be thicker


record target pose (and find out what it is used for) OK
adjust exploration space OK
adjust side cam crop OK
correct gripper opening OK
speed up rotation OK?

clear queue when resetting OK
classifier seems to be working fine -> showed demos succesfully OK
robot does not obey intervention: cant rotate much or approach insertion housing: config? OK
try training pick and insert separetely OK
